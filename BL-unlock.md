- Wait for WPInternals to do their job, WPInternals may need an assistance, so pay attention what WPInternals tell you.

## Troubleshooting

If running on a Windows with only .NET 4.7.2 or newer you might see issues with WPInternals, with an app config file you can as a workaround ensure it's running under the latest framework and with required SSL settings. 
Create a file named `WPinternals.exe.config` in same folder as `WPinternals.exe` with the following contents
```xml
<configuration>
    <runtime>
        <AppContextSwitchOverrides value="Switch.System.Net.DontEnableSystemDefaultTlsVersions=false;Switch.System.Net.DontEnableSchUseStrongCrypto=false"/>
    </runtime>
    <startup>
        <supportedRuntime version="v4.0" sku=".NETFramework,Version=v4.7" />
    </startup>
</configuration>
```
